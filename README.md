## Description
This is a rigged, textured, animated model of an coffee press that I made in Blender.
The materials are meant for Cycles rendering engine and won't look right in Eevee.

##  Usage
To see the materials, change the `Viewport Shading` setting from `Solid` to `Rendered`.
Press `0` on the numpad to see the camera view of the coffee press.
While in the `Animation` workspace, press `SHIFT + SPACE BAR` to see the animation play.
